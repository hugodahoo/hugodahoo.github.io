## SPECTRAL SUBJECTS

“Spectral Subjects” is a thermal observatory that displays a constantly updating map of the room's temperature. Using thermographic cameras, the project detects heat and cold in the environment, including the building’s air circulation and ventilation, visitors’ body heat, and inanimate objects. As temperature is detected, the artwork creates a visible manifestation of the public’s “heat signature” in various ways, mixing live feeds with recently past heat signatures, materializing thermal echoes of the atmosphere, and creating an evolving portrait of uncanny spectral traces that make the atmosphere tangible. The artwork has two versions: a unique projection-based treatment that can be adapted to any architecture, and an edition that can be adapted to flatscreens of different sizes.

## Halte 0 Sépaq Îles-de-Boucherville

An outdoor projection along the water that celebrates Québec’s natural heritage. The site itself—wind, water, insects—becomes part of the piece’s motion picture.

Technical details and implementation
- Projection mapping onto terrain/structures; nature‑recording‑infused sound.
- Weatherized enclosures; long‑throw projection across water.

Challenges and solutions
- Outdoor unpredictability → robust housings, anti‑condensation, remote monitoring.
- Visitor safety and path lighting while preserving darkness.

Impact and results
- Expanded park programming; brought new audiences after dark.
- A gentle, respectful intervention in a protected landscape.

Process and methodology
- Site surveys; throw tests across water; power routing.
- Evening‑of adjustments for wind, haze, and wildlife activity.
