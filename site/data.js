        "fullDescription": "Collider is a light installation that translates invisible cosmic radiation into visible form. In its first iteration, presented at Translation Island in Abu Dhabi in 2023, hundreds of pencil-beam robotic searchlights formed a glimmering curtain of light visible from Lulu Island and downtown Abu Dhabi. The lights responded in real time to muons—subatomic particles produced when cosmic rays from stars and black holes collide with Earth’s atmosphere. Sensors adapted from Geiger counters detected the angle of these particles, and the live data was mapped directly into the shifting geometry of the light curtain.
The second iteration, installed on the façade of the Parrish Art Museum’s Herzog & de Meuron building, replaced searchlights with hundreds of small LED spotlights. Here, the data shaped a calm, rippling curtain of light across the museum’s architecture, offering a more intimate encounter with the same cosmic phenomena. In both versions, Collider turns distant astrophysical events into a perceptible, architectural experience.
**Technical details and implementation**
- Live data feed from cosmic ray detectors captures real-time radiation events
- Custom visualization engine maps event energy and angle to dynamic particles, trails, and bursts

Created during a period when Sor Juana faced censorship from the Catholic Church and the Inquisition, the poem reflects her struggle to uphold rationalist principles while living within a religious order.
The installation employs a double layer of language: beneath lies the full text of the poem, while above it golden words drift like streamers, animated through fluid dynamics to resemble a flame in slow motion—the flame of knowledge. In its standalone version, the work unfolds on an elongated screen, where an ascending vortex of words gradually reveals the transcendental scope of Sor Juana’s vision.

Ten audiovisual artworks—six of them world premieres—transformed the deserted island into a two-kilometre-long night-time path through sand dunes, desert flora, beaches, and freshwater lakes.
Commissioned by Abu Dhabi’s Department for Culture and Tourism, the project was conceived as an “ode to translation,” understood both as the rendering of one language into another and as the relocation of subjects in space. The works combined AI, computer vision, environmental sensing, and 3D mapping to create poetic experiences in the desert landscape.
Pieces such as Collider translated cosmic radiation into a colossal curtain of light visible from 10 kilometers away, while Thermal Drift, Dune Ringers, and Pulse Island revealed biometric signatures—body heat, voice, heartbeat—through projection mapping and fields of glowing bulbs. Other works addressed language directly: Translation Stream projected streams of letters that reorganized around visitors to reveal poems by Emirati poets in Arabic and English; Shadow Tuner allowed visitors to tune into thousands of live radio stations worldwide with their shadows; and Translation Lake used AI voice avatars to endlessly translate James Joyce’s Finnegan’s Wake into 24 languages.
By gathering these pieces into a single nocturnal journey, Translation Island wove together histories of translation—from the Tower of Babel to the Library of Alexandria and the Abbasid House of Wisdom—while engaging with the promises and absurdities of contemporary AI.
Technical details and implementation
- Weatherproof projection/lighting integrated with site features.
- Sensors along the path to pace narrative reveals.
- Multilingual text and audio assets for inclusive access.
Challenges and solutions
- Harsh outdoor conditions → sealed housings, high‑lumen projectors, scheduled maintenance.
- Crowd flow → distributed triggers and clear path sightlines.
Impact and results
- Turns public space into a participatory story; invites repeat walks to catch different timings.
- Signals the city’s commitment to cultural programming.
Process and methodology
- Site survey and storyboarding per waypoint.
- Modular rigging and power planning.
- Night‑time calibration runs in situ.

Exhibited from February 25 to April 24, 2022 at Casa de México in Madrid, the show brought together eight works under a shared curatorial frame linking textuality and visual abstraction.
Using algorithms borrowed from fluid dynamics and non-linear systems, the pieces deconstruct and recompose texts by authors such as Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, George Orwell, Julio Cortázar, and Stuart Hall. One standout is Primero Sueño Recurrente, rendered through 45 flat suspended screens forming a spiraling paraboloid; words emerge as an ascending vortex across the screens.
Rather than delivering literal readings, Caudales foregrounds unstable typographic flows and the agency of the viewer in navigating meaning.

Sequences of ocean waves crash across the screen, releasing airborne text particles that represent acronyms of hormones. Each hormone appears according to its natural rhythm, turning the invisible cycles of the body into flowing audiovisual patterns.
The piece incorporates circadian rhythms, releasing cortisol, progesterone, and testosterone in the morning; FSH and LH in the afternoon; and oestradiol and prolactin at night. Ultradian rhythms—shorter cycles within the day—are shown through leptin and ghrelin fluctuations. Infradian rhythms—longer cycles such as the 28-day hormonal variations of estrogen, FSH, progesterone, and LH—also appear. Finally, a 90-year lifespan cycle charts long-term changes such as the decline of aldosterone, calcitonin, GH, and renin, and the rise of cortisol. After 90 years, the work resets, beginning the cycles anew.
By mapping these rhythms into an endless ocean of words, Hormonium makes the body’s hidden cycles perceptible through the language of waves.
Technical details and implementation
- Cyclical waveform engines with parameterized phase/period relationships.
- Projection mapping or screen presentation; ambient or focal modes.
Challenges and solutions
- Keeping long‑run interest → slow evolution with punctuated ‘events’.
- Scaling from intimate to architectural surfaces.
Impact and results

The work presents a fictional fragment of mountainous terrain as a “sample of planet Earth,” built from 3D-printed forms coated in plaster and precisely mapped with 4K projection, Kinect 2.0 depth sensing, and a stereo sound system.
Natural cycles of water, wind, erosion, and the seasons animate the surface, bringing the static relief to life. When visitors approach, pass a hand in front of the projection, or touch the sculpture, the ecosystem reacts with fire and destruction. The more it is disturbed, the longer it takes to regenerate. This mechanic makes each visitor directly responsible for the health of the landscape and the experience of others.
Premiered in 2021 at Never Apart Gallery in Montreal and permanently acquired by Age of Union’s Earth Center in 2022, Écosystemes is both poetic and provocative—raising awareness of our impact on fragile environments by turning every gesture into an ecological choice.

At the heart of the exhibition was Duffy, an AI “artist” who invited visitors to collaborate inside her Symbiotic Studio. Through real-time tracking, projection mapping, and interactive technology, guests became muses for the AI. Their movements were captured and transformed into an infinite series of images, as Duffy drew on vast datasets of colors and archetypal forms from the natural world. The result was an ongoing stream of surprising, artificial interpretations of humanity and nature.
Open from September 2020 to January 2021, the exhibition was Moment Factory’s first fully remote production. The Montreal studio designed and directed the experience while UCCA Lab and technical partner Digital Fun supported on-site integration. Despite the pandemic, the project successfully introduced Chinese audiences to a playful collaboration between people and machines.
Technical details and implementation
- Multi‑room projections and soundscapes; motion‑driven narrative triggers.

Before the station opened to the public, the unfinished underground space was transformed into an immersive environment combining projection mapping, lighting, sound design, and interactivity. Visitors began their journey in a decommissioned cinema, where a body scan generated a unique “personal frequency” in 3D that was later integrated into the visuals. They then moved through the construction site, reimagined as a futuristic audiovisual landscape.
The project required close collaboration with architects and engineers, as the space was still under construction and constantly changing until launch. A multidisciplinary team adapted the stage design, technical systems, and content to fit the evolving environment.
Kontinuum attracted thousands of visitors and received international recognition, including a Merit Award for Experiential Design at the 2018 ADC Awards and an Award of Excellence in the 2017 Communication Arts Interactive Competition.

        "fullDescription": "Aura — Traversée immersive (2016) was a one-night installation presented during Nuit Blanche à Montréal, transforming Place Pasteur on rue Saint-Denis into an illuminated forest.
The project combined projection mapping on the clocher of Place Pasteur with an environment built from fibre-optic light trees and interactive mushrooms that reacted to touch. As visitors walked through, their presence and gestures triggered shifts in light and atmosphere, gradually revealing a lush, animated landscape emerging from the winter setting.
This was my first large-scale projection using TouchDesigner, where I developed the interactive system that linked participant presence to the evolving visuals. Participation was central: each person’s presence “fed” the installation with light, making the forest denser and more alive over time.
**Technical details and implementation**
- Large-scale interior projection mapping system designed specifically for the basilica's complex architecture
- Multi-channel sound system creating immersive audio that complements the visual experience
- Permanent infrastructure with careful mounting and alignment to preserve historic materials
- Sophisticated content creation pipeline that respects the building's sacred character
**Challenges and solutions**
- Respecting sacred space and historic materials required careful planning and preservation-safe installation practices
- Creating rendering that flatters ornate surfaces without glare demanded precise projection mapping and content design
- Balancing artistic vision with religious sensitivity required ongoing collaboration with church authorities
**Impact and results**
- Achieved immense public popularity and became a long-running cultural program
- Successfully helped reposition the Basilica as a major cultural venue in Montreal
- Demonstrated how technology can enhance rather than diminish the spiritual experience of sacred spaces
**Process and methodology**
