# 🎨 Hover State as Default - Easy Rollback System

## 📋 Current Status

**ROLLED BACK** - Currently using original hover behavior. Project cards start in normal state and show enhanced effects only on hover.

## 🔄 Easy Rollback Options

### Option 1: Use the Toggle Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the interactive toggle script
toggle-hover-mode.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual HTML Change
In `site/index.html`, change:
```html
<!-- Current (hover as default) -->
<body class="neural-network-style hover-as-default">

<!-- To rollback (original hover behavior) -->
<body class="neural-network-style original-hover">
```

### Option 3: Quick Enable Script
```bash
# To re-enable hover as default
enable-hover-default.bat
```

## 🎯 What Changes

### Default State (New)
- ✅ Project cards are scaled up (2.0x) and rotated (5deg)
- ✅ Enhanced shadows and depth effects
- ✅ Thumbnails are scaled and positioned for better visibility
- ✅ Project titles are visible by default
- ✅ Hover text (green background) appears only on hover

### Original Hover Behavior (Rollback)
- ✅ Cards start in normal state
- ✅ Hover to see enhanced effects
- ✅ Traditional hover interactions

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **More Engaging**: Cards immediately show their full potential
2. **Better Visibility**: Thumbnails and content are more prominent
3. **Professional Look**: Enhanced depth and shadows create premium feel
4. **Easy Rollback**: Simple one-line change to revert

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The system uses CSS classes to control the behavior:
- `hover-as-default`: Applies hover styles by default
- `original-hover`: Uses traditional hover behavior

All hover effects are preserved - they just happen by default instead of on hover.
